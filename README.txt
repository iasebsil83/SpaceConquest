-------------------- Space Conquest --------------------

Space conquest is a simple 2D game made in C using the
Ghislain OUDINET's GfxLib.

It is a sandbox-like game. You begin your adventure on a
planet and try to catch the more ressources you can.

Then you can craft some more sofisticated stuff such as
space suits or rockets !

Explore your galaxy (generated randomly) to discover new
planets.

It was made for a challenge of ISEN Engineering at the
end of 2018.

All it requires to run is the glut library (freeglut3-dev
on linux, should normally work on MacOS systems...)

Anyway, further informations such as versions are
available in SpaceConquest.c.

This is a tiny project, the game time is quite limited,
it was my first big C project.
Pay attention, there is no save system!
